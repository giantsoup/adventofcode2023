# Advent of Code 2023
I am running this in PHP 8.2.6.

To download PHP in macOS
- `brew install php@8.2`

To download PHP in Ubuntu
- `sudo apt install php8.2-cli`

Then follow instructions to install on your machine. Once you have php installed you can run `php -v` to make sure its working. Once you have confirmed its working, you can run any php file like this `php day1/solutions.php` and you will see the answer and any logs in the terminal.
